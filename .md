Let's summarize the problem. The problem is to find two bases of a prime number P such that P mod a = P mod b and 2 ≤ a < b ≤ P. The input consists of multiple test cases, each containing a prime number P. The output should consist of two integers a and b for each test case. If there are multiple possible solutions, print any.
Let's make some observation. If P is odd, then P mod a = P mod b for all a and b. If P is even, then P mod a = P mod b for all a such that a is even and a ≡ 1 \pmod P. If P is even, then P mod b = P mod a for all b such that b is even and b ≡ 1 \pmod P.
So the plan is:
Read the number of test cases t.
For each test case:.
	Read the prime number P.
	If P is odd, then print a = 2 and b = P.
	Otherwise, print a = 1 and b = P.
