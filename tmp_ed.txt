Understanding the Problem:
	Researchers are studying fish populations in a system of interconnected lakes and rivers.
	The system is a tree-like structure with lakes as nodes and rivers as edges.
	Fish move between lakes through rivers, with travel time depending on river length.
	Researchers have made observations of fish numbers in specific lakes on specific days.
	The goal is to determine the minimum number of fish needed to satisfy all observations.
Initial Approach:
	Consider each fish observation as an element in a partially ordered set (poset).
	Order observations based on the possibility of the same fish moving between them (considering time and distance).
	The problem becomes finding the smallest number of chains (sequences of comparable elements) to cover all observations.
	Dilworth's theorem equates this to the size of the largest antichain (set of incomparable elements).
	A brute-force approach of checking all subsets of observations is too slow (O(2^k)).
Utilizing Tree Structure:
	Introduce a criterion to check if a set of observations forms an antichain:
		The subset of observations within each subtree must also be an antichain.
		There exists a time moment when no observation in the set can reach the root of the tree.
	This criterion leverages the tree structure to simplify the antichain check.
Dynamic Programming Approach:
	Define a dynamic programming state dp(v, t) as the maximum weight of an antichain in the subtree of node v, with the condition that no observation can reach v at time t.
	The weight of an antichain is the total number of fish in the observations it contains.
	Transitions involve combining DP values from subtrees and accounting for observations at each node.
Efficient Implementation:
	Store the DP values as differences between consecutive time points to save space.
	Use a treap data structure to maintain these differences efficiently.
	Treap operations (merging, splitting) allow for combining DP values from subtrees and updating values based on observations.
	Time shifting is handled lazily by maintaining an offset value for each treap.
Overall Complexity:
	The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n + k log^2 k), where n is the number of lakes and k is the number of observations.
	The treap data structure ensures efficient operations for maintaining and updating DP values.
