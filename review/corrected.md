Let's surround the matrix with a frame of elements. In each element of the matrix, and frame we need to store the value, the number of the right element, and the number of the down element. When a request comes, we should change only the values of the elements along the perimeter of rectangles.

Time Complexity: $O(q(n+m))$.
