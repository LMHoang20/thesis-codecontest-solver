It is easy to understand that there is an optimal vector at which the value we need is minimal and at least one pair of projections is touching. Note also that the vector is completely described by the angle between it and the positive direction of the $OX$ axis. If two line segments are at different heights, then there are two ways to select a vector so that their projections touch. Let's find two angles that describe these vectors. If we project along a vector with an angle that is in the interval that the found two angles form, then the projections will intersect. So, this range of angles is 'forbidden'. Using the scanline method, we can find such angles that they are the boundaries of some 'forbidden' interval and do not fall into any 'forbidden' interval. Then we only need to check these angles.
We also need to quickly find the rightmost and leftmost points for each angle. Let's take two points at different heights. Let them project to one point with a vector with an angle $\alpha$. Then on the interval $(0^\circ;\alpha)$ the upper one will be to the right, and on the interval $ (\alpha; 180^\circ)$ the upper one will be to the left. We will process two types of requests using the scanning line:
-  Check the answer for the current angle;
-  Swap two points. It is necessary to carefully handle the case when, at some angle, several points are swapped.
Alternative way: if you project the point $(x; y)$ along the vector with the angle $\alpha$, you get the point $(x + y * ctg (\alpha); 0)$. We'll use the **Convex Hull Trick** to quickly find the rightmost and leftmost points for each angle. We will store CHT for maximums and minimums with lines $ k = y_i, b = x_i $. Queries at $ctg(\alpha)$ will give us the leftmost and rightmost points.
It is a corner case if all points are at the same height. Then the answer is $max(xr_i) - min(xl_i)$.
Complexity of solution - $O(n^2log(n))$.
