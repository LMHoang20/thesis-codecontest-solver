The problem asks us to find the number of pairs of elements that can be deleted from an array such that the mean of the remaining elements remains the same.

We can start by finding the mean of the array. Let's call it `k`. Then, for each pair of elements, we can check if deleting them would result in a mean of `k`.

To check this, we can use the following formula:

```
(sum - a_i - a_j) / (n - 2) = k
```

where `sum` is the sum of all elements in the array, `a_i` and `a_j` are the elements being deleted, and `n` is the number of elements in the array.

If the above equation holds, then deleting the elements `a_i` and `a_j` would result in a mean of `k`.

We can use this formula to check all pairs of elements in the array and count the number of pairs that satisfy the equation.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where `n` is the number of elements in the array.
