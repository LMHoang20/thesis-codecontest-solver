**Polycarp's Dislike of Threes**

Polycarp is a peculiar individual with a strong aversion to the number three. He despises integers divisible by three or ending in the digit three. Even numbers that satisfy both conditions evoke his disdain.

To express his distaste, Polycarp has embarked on a mission to write out a sequence of positive integers that adhere to his preferences. The sequence begins with 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, and so on.

Your task is to determine the k-th element of this sequence for a given input k. Each test case consists of a single integer k, and you must output the corresponding element from Polycarp's sequence.

**Example:**

For k = 1, the output is 1.
For k = 2, the output is 2.
For k = 3, the output is 4.
For k = 4, the output is 5.
For k = 5, the output is 7.
For k = 6, the output is 8.
For k = 7, the output is 10.
For k = 8, the output is 11.
For k = 9, the output is 14.
For k = 1000, the output is 1666.
