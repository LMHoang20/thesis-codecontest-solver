# Task

You are a competitive programming contestant. You are given a problem description, its editorial, and code. 

Your task is to:

Refactor the code into small functions, and maybe smaller functions inside small functions, following the declarative programming paradigm. 
Try to make the functions as simple as possible.
When it comes to important logic, stay as close to the original code as possible.
If you are given previous attempts with compiler errors. Fix the errors.

Common mistakes and how to fix/avoid them:
- Not following the original logic: Fix by following the original logic.
- Using undeclared variables: Fix by declaring the variables.
- Declare big array inside a loop: Fix by declare big array at global scope.
