The problem is to determine if it is possible to make two integers a and b equal using exactly k turns. In one turn, we can divide a by an integer c if a is divisible by c, or divide b by an integer c if b is divisible by c. The numbers a and b can be made equal in a maximum of $n$ turns, where $n$ is the sum of exponents of prime divisors of $a$ plus the sum of exponents of prime divisors of $b$. The numbers a and b can be made equal in a minimum of $m$ turns, where $m$ is 0 if $a=b$, 1 if $gcd (a, b)=a$ or $gcd (a, b)=b$, and 2 otherwise. The answer is "Yes" if $m \le k \le n$ and $k=1$ and $m = 1$, or $m \le k \le n$ and $k \ne 1$. The maximum number of moves for which the numbers $a$ and $b$ can be made equal is $n$, where $n$ is the sum of exponents of prime divisors of $a$ plus the sum of exponents of prime divisors of $b$. The minimum number of moves for which the numbers $a$ and $b$ can be made equal is $m$, where $m$ is 0 if $a=b$, 1 if $gcd (a, b)=a$ or $gcd (a, b)=b$, and 2 otherwise. The answer is "Yes" if $m \le k \le n$ and $k=1$ and $m = 1$, or $m \le k \le n$ and $k \ne 1$. Precalculate the prime numbers up to a certain limit. Decompose the numbers $a$ and $b$ into their prime factors. Calculate the minimum and maximum number of moves required to make the numbers equal. Check if the given number of moves $k$ is within the range of possible moves. Output "Yes" if the answer is "Yes", and "No" otherwise.
